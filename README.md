### Hi there üëã

My name is Micha≈Ç and I'm React-fascinated frontend developer.  
So far, my whole professional life concerns about CNC programming/machining and industry labor in general, however, as far as I remember, I was interested in IT technologies, free and open-source software, Linux and so on.  
In last years, I've started to think seriously about changing my profession toward frontend development, completed my education by finishing a course in [YouCode](https://www.youcode.pl) programming school owned by Chris DƒÖbrowski, and exercise in everyday coding.
